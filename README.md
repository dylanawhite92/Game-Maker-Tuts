A place to house the tutorials I'm working through in Game Maker Studio 2 in order to better understand the interface.

## Space Rocks
An Asteroids copy where a player pilots a triangular ship on a black field populated by randomly generated asteroids. 
The player fires bullets and breaks apart asteroids until they are removed from the field. Just like Asteroids, the field 
wraps around if the player tries to fly off-screen. This also applies to the asteroids. A player tries to reach a score 
of 100 to win the game, and they have 3 lives with which to survive the barrage of merciless space rocks.
